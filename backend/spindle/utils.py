    Serializes a list of LexicalPhrases in a human-readable infix notation that is already available in Ã†thel in Type.__repr__ or type_repr(). This is used to display the types in the frontend.

    The standard JSON serialization of phrases uses a prefix notation for types, which is good for data-exchange purposes (easier parsing) but less ideal for human consumption. This notation will be used to query.
